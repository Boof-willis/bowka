			question: "How much does it cost to build a custom home in Utah?",
			answer: "Custom home construction costs vary widely based on size, location, and finishes. As a general estimate, expect $200–$350+ per square foot for a complete build. A 2,500 sq ft custom home ranges from $500,000 to $875,000+. We provide detailed estimates based on your specific plans and goals."
		},
		{
			question: "How long does it take to build a custom home?",

		},
		{
			question: "Do I need to own a lot before starting?",

		},
		{
			question: "Can I use my own architect or plans?",
			answer: "Absolutely. If you already have plans, we'll review them, provide a bid, and manage the construction. If you need design help, we can connect you with trusted architects and designers."

		<h2>Why Build Custom?</h2>
		<p>
			A custom home lets you design every detail to fit your family's needs. You choose the layout, the finishes, the lot, and the location. You're not compromising on someone else's floor plan or settling for a spec home that's almost right. If you have a vision and a lot, we'll help you build it.
		</p>

		<h2>Our Role as Your General Contractor</h2>
		<p>
			Building a home involves dozens of trades, hundreds of decisions, and constant coordination. As your general contractor, we manage the entire process. We hire and oversee subcontractors, order materials, schedule inspections, and ensure every phase meets our quality standards. You'll have a single point of contact (Brady) who keeps you informed and makes the process as smooth as possible.
		</p>

		<h2>Design & Planning</h2>
		<p>
			If you already have plans, we'll review them for constructibility and provide a detailed bid. If you're starting from scratch, we work with architects and designers to create plans that fit your vision and budget. We'll guide you through decisions on layout, finishes, and features, helping you prioritize what matters most.
		</p>

		<h2>What to Expect</h2>
		<p>
			<strong>Pre-Construction (2–4 months):</strong> Design, permitting, and subcontractor bids. We finalize plans and establish a budget and timeline.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Foundation & Framing (2–3 months):</strong> Site prep, foundation, framing, and roof. Your home starts taking shape.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>MEP & Exterior (2–3 months):</strong> Plumbing, electrical, HVAC, siding, windows, and exterior finishes.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Interior Finishing (3–4 months):</strong> Drywall, flooring, trim, cabinets, countertops, and fixtures. This is where your home comes to life.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Final Inspections & Move-In:</strong> We complete punch list items, pass final inspections, and hand you the keys.
		</p>

		<h2>Where We Build</h2>
		<p>
			We build custom homes throughout Utah County, Salt Lake County, and Davis County. Popular build locations include: Lehi, Saratoga Springs, Eagle Mountain, Alpine, Highland, Draper, Herriman, and Farmington. If you have a lot in our service area, we'd love to build your home.
