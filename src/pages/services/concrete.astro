	faqs={[
		{
			question: "How much does a concrete driveway cost in Utah?",
			answer: "Concrete driveways typically cost $8–$15 per square foot depending on thickness, reinforcement, and finish. A standard two-car driveway (20x20, 400 sq ft) ranges from $3,200 to $6,000. Stamped or decorative concrete costs more."
		},
		{
			question: "How long does concrete take to cure?",
			answer: "Concrete reaches functional strength (safe for light foot traffic) in 24–48 hours. Full cure takes 28 days. We recommend waiting at least 7 days before parking vehicles on a new driveway."
		},
		{
			question: "Will my concrete crack?",
			answer: "Concrete will develop small cracks over time — it's the nature of the material. We minimize cracking by using proper base preparation, reinforcement (rebar or wire mesh), control joints, and proper curing. We pour thick, well-reinforced slabs designed for Utah's climate."
		},
		{
			question: "What's the difference between stamped and regular concrete?",
			answer: "Regular concrete is smooth or broom-finished. Stamped concrete is textured with patterns (stone, brick, slate) and often colored. Stamped concrete looks more decorative and is popular for patios and walkways. It costs more but adds curb appeal."
		},
		{
			question: "Do you pour concrete in winter?",
			answer: "We can pour concrete in winter with proper precautions (heated blankets, additives). However, we prefer to schedule concrete work in spring, summer, and fall for optimal curing conditions."

		<h2>Why Quality Concrete Matters in Utah</h2>
		<p>
			Utah's climate is tough on concrete. Freeze-thaw cycles, temperature swings, and snow/ice exposure can cause cracking, spalling, and settling if concrete isn't poured properly. We use the right mix design, proper reinforcement, and correct curing techniques to ensure your concrete lasts.
		</p>

		<h2>Concrete Services We Offer</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Driveways</strong> — Standard or stamped, single or multi-car. We pour driveways that handle Utah winters.</li>
			<li><strong>Patios</strong> — Outdoor living spaces, fire pit surrounds, and entertaining areas. Smooth, broom, or stamped finishes.</li>
			<li><strong>Walkways & Sidewalks</strong> — Front entry walks, side yard paths, and backyard trails.</li>
			<li><strong>Foundations</strong> — Slab and stem wall foundations for additions, garages, and new construction.</li>
			<li><strong>Basement Floors</strong> — Concrete floor installation or repair for unfinished basements.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Stamped & Decorative Concrete</h2>
		<p>
			Stamped concrete replicates the look of stone, brick, or tile at a fraction of the cost. We offer a variety of patterns and integral color options. Popular choices: ashlar slate, flagstone, cobblestone, and wood plank. Stamped concrete is sealed for durability and is a popular choice for patios and walkways.
		</p>

		<h2>Proper Base Preparation</h2>
		<p>
			The longevity of your concrete starts below the surface. We excavate to the proper depth, install a compacted gravel base (4–6 inches), and ensure proper drainage. We don't skip steps. Many concrete failures are caused by poor base prep — we do it right.
