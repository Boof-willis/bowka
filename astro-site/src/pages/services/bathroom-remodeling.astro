		{
			question: "How much does a bathroom remodel cost in Utah?",
			answer: "A full bathroom remodel typically ranges from $15,000 to $40,000 depending on size and finishes. A standard 5x8 guest bath with new tile, vanity, and fixtures runs $15,000–$25,000. Master bath remodels with double vanities, large tile showers, and high-end finishes range from $30,000–$50,000+."
		},
		{
			question: "How long does a bathroom remodel take?",
			answer: "Most bathroom remodels take 2–4 weeks. Simple vanity and tile updates can be done in 1–2 weeks. Full gut renovations with layout changes take longer. We provide a clear timeline and keep you updated."
		},
		{
			question: "Can you make my bathroom more accessible?",
			answer: "Yes. We install walk-in showers (zero threshold or low curb), grab bars, comfort-height toilets, and accessible vanities. Many Utah families remodel bathrooms specifically for aging in place."
		},
		{
			question: "What tile do you recommend for showers?",
			answer: "We install ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone tile. For showers, we recommend porcelain for durability and water resistance. Large-format tiles (12x24 or larger) reduce grout lines and are easier to clean. We always use proper waterproofing membranes behind the tile."

		<h2>Why Remodel Your Bathroom?</h2>
		<p>
			Bathrooms take a beating. Daily use, moisture, and wear lead to outdated finishes, cracked tile, and fixtures that don't work like they should. Whether you're modernizing a dated bathroom, creating a spa-like retreat, or making your bathroom safer and more accessible, we'll help you design and build it.
		</p>

		<h2>Common Bathroom Remodel Types</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Master Bath Remodel</strong> — Double vanities, large tile showers, soaking tubs, heated floors, and luxury finishes.</li>
			<li><strong>Guest Bath Update</strong> — Refresh finishes, update fixtures, and improve storage without a full gut.</li>
			<li><strong>Accessible / Aging-in-Place Bathroom</strong> — Walk-in showers, grab bars, and comfort-height fixtures for safety and independence.</li>
			<li><strong>Basement Bathroom Addition</strong> — Add a full or half bath to your finished basement.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Tile Selection and Installation</h2>
		<p>
			Tile is the defining feature of most bathroom remodels. We install ceramic, porcelain, and natural stone tile in a variety of sizes and styles. Popular choices: large-format porcelain (12x24, 24x48), classic subway tile, mosaic accent tiles, and wood-look tile for floors.
		</p>
		<p>
			We waterproof properly using Schluter systems or equivalent, ensuring your shower and tub surrounds are protected from moisture damage. We don't cut corners.
